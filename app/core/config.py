**PRIMARY ENGINE — "Describe what's already theirs" (user's words):**
This is the most important input. The story AND the theme MUST be driven directly by this text. Do not substitute a generic or beautiful narrative. Every core idea, feeling, and detail in the story must come from what the user wrote. If their words are short, vague, or unusual, the story must still reflect and expand only from those words — never invent a different desire. The theme must also reflect this same specific desire, not a generic category headline."""

OUTPUT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTION = f"""

**Output format (follow exactly):**
1. First line: THEME: <your theme>
   Theme style: "A Love That Was Already Yours", "The Love You'd Always Known", "The Abundance That Arrived" — short, evocative. The theme MUST reflect the user's specific desire, not a generic category.
2. One blank line.
3. Then the story only (no headers). Aim for 350–450 words; do not exceed {STORY_MAX_CHARS} characters."""
